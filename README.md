# CS480: Course Registration Website
By: Samuel Haddad, Pradnya Sonawane, Ayush Shah

In our project, we will be making a course registration website that will primarily involve students (our users in this case) registering for courses at an institution such as UIC. On top of registration, our database and website will support schedule planning, where a student can say what courses they want to take, and we will show what a schedule of those courses would look like all together. 

In our database we will have students, courses, instructors, schedules (for students who have registered for some courses), fees (how much each course costs), and more as needed. On top of these entities, we will have many relationships between these entities, such as which instructors are teaching which courses, which students are taking which courses, how much each student is going to be paying for their upcoming schedule, what courses students have already taken, and more as needed. 

Another potential component of the website can be that a user can enter a course they want to take (say cs 480), and the website will display to them what classes they need to take beforehand (prerequisites) as well as what gpa they need to have to take it (if it is locked behind a certain grade threshold). With the info that the database has for each student, it can then say whether or not they are eligible to take the class, and if they are not, what it is they need to do (take class X, raise gpa to Y, etc). 

Note: This is an inital project description, and will be revised as needed when more project specifications come out!
